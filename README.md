# Skeleton

Rapid Prototyping Framework with all the styleguide goodies built in. This is intended quick project starts.

## Notes

Projects require initial setup of scss/_vars.scss and includes/variables/page_variables.php

## TODO's

* Build Process efficiencies
* Rework PHP framework for better dependency between skeleton and accompanying styleguide
* Move View Source feature into inner-sections
