# Skeleton

Rapid Prototyping Framework with all the styleguide goodies built in, enabling fast project starts.

## Notes

Projects require initial setup of scss/globals/_vars.scss and includes/variables/global\_variables.php

All sections in the styleguide are included by default, they can be turned off at styleguide/variables/page_variables.php

## TODO's

* Build Process efficiencies
* Rework PHP framework for better dependency between skeleton and accompanying styleguide
* Move View Source feature into inner-sections
